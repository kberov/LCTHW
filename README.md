My excersises from "Learn C The Hard Way" - http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/

I decided to go trough the book "Learn C The Hard Way" and make the excersises with all the recommended by the author changes. You will not find here the excercises as they are in the book. Rather you will see the result of me playing with them after they were entered letter by letter. All the excercises must compile successfully to consider this project done.

What I am trying to achieve is to be able to say "I know C enough to implement a program from scratch". This will be my foundation to my next steps - being able to use C vrom Perl and vice versa.
